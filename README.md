What it Is 
-----------
* Its CodeIgniter with PhpMailer

But Why? 
-----------
* PhpMailer lets you do stuff. For me I needed a mailer to send an email with an attachment.
* PhpMailer has an estimated 9 million users
* Integrated SMTP support - send without a local mail server
* Send emails with multiple TOs, CCs, BCCs and REPLY-TOs
* Just check it out - [GitHub](https://github.com/Synchro/PHPMailer)

OK I got it, how do I make it work
-----------
Simples.
* Open application->models->email_model and configure your mailer
